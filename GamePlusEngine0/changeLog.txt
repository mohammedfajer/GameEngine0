---------------------------------------------------------------
[] Cleanup Animation Scene and apply compression oriented to get animation working
[] Get a player scene with animation and movement
[] Get the camera behaviour done and apply compression oriented on that
[] replace glm::vec2/3/4 and glm::mat4 with the apprivated ones, and same for types real32, i32, etc...
[] Delete the OrthographicComponent.h/cpp
